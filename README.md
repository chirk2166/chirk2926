## Summary
I started programming when I was in the first year of junior high school and have been doing it little by little.
I mainly use HTML, CSS, Java, and javascript, and I am currently studying Python.

## career
For my social experience, I created a small community of friends on the Internet and school friends and started a small game server rental service, starting with one that would make games available to the public nationwide and teach people how to fix code errors.
I believe that I gained experience in managing a small community and working with others in an organizational setting.
It was interesting and stimulating to meet new people as we grew a bit in size, and to meet some amazing people. In fact, I started this kind of community because I met those amazing people and became interested in that field.
I think it was a great experience for me to do all of the above.
